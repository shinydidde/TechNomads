1.Technology Stack Selection

1.1 Python:
Python version 3.11 is used majorly for developing the backend of this application. We selected python for our project due to its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks such as integration with AWS using Boto3. And the community support for the same is substantial. Along with its performance and scalability of building the real time huge application makes great choices. Also, Python is open to the Cross-Platform. 

1.2 AWS Lambda:
	We are using Python for the backend services and the same is developed and deployed in the AWS Lambda services, the reason for usage of AWS lambda is the power of its serverless computing services also the scalability of the service is based upon usage, meaning the services will be scaled based upon the traffic being one of the best solutions to use it in our systems. Also, Python with API gateway through Lambda manages the CORS configuration and issues to a greater extent.

1.3 Microsoft SQL Server:
	As our system is structured and deals with the structured data for nearly all the cases. We are aligned to be using the SQL database systems for its fast retrieving of the data and CRUD operations. Due to this requirement, one of the best system is for us to use Microsoft SQL server for the database capabilities and we used AWS RDS(Relational Database Systems) for deploying our database and the reason for using RDS services is to keep our DB live 24*7 and be accessible always without any downtime and that is powered through its AWS infrastructure.

1.4 FE Contents
Choice of Framework and Technologies
Genie uses the following technologies and frameworks if FE:
React.js: For building the user interface.
Firebase: For user authentication and session management.
AWS API Gateway: For backend APIs.
Material-UI: For UI components and styling.
Axios: For making HTTP requests.
React Router: For handling navigation and routing.

Genie uses Google Auth for login and Firebase Auth which is a client side service to handle the user authentication and session in a simple and secure way. Firebase Authentication will handle the session and token management Hence, making it easier to maintain the userâ€™s session across different pages/routes without any backend.


1.5 Render
	Render is a cloud platform as a service (PAAS), which allows the developers to deploy their developed Frontend applications in their system. Render makes the deployment of our applications easy, cost-effective, manage and scale its operation. And this is one of the quickest-way to deploy the application without worrying much about the deployment of our Frontend systems.
