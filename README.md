# MERN Stack Project with Material-UI and Internationalization

This is a sample MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack project with Material-UI integration and internationalization support using react-i18next.

## Features

- MongoDB for database storage
- Express.js for backend API
- React with Material-UI for frontend UI components
- Node.js for server-side logic
- Internationalization (i18n) support for multiple languages

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn installed
- MongoDB installed locally or access to a MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory for configuring MongoDB connection details and other environment-specific variables.

5. Start the development servers:
   - Frontend (React):
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```
   - Backend (Node.js/Express):
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```

6. Access your application:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the frontend.
   - The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Folder Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend code.
- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js/Express backend code.
- `public/`: Static assets for the frontend.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

- Customize the frontend and backend as per your requirements.
- Add more routes, components, and features based on your application needs.
- Implement additional internationalization features using react-i18next for supporting multiple languages.
